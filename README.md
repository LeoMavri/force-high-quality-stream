# "Forcing Nitro"
Allows you to stream in any quality regardless of your nitro status / server boost level.

Because Discord is actually competent (unlike Valve) you can't do any of the other nitro related stuff (uploading more than 8 megs, having an animated pfp or setting your tag to whatever etc.). 

_**While those may show up as possible, they'll:
a) Do nothing.
b) Throw an error within Discord.**_
